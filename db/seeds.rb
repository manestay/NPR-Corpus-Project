    paragraphs: ["MICHELE NORRIS, host:", "Back in the US, AIDS has claimed the life of a poet who chronicled her struggles with the disease. Tory Dent wrote about AIDS using experimental form and unflinching language. After discovering she was HIV-positive at age 30, Dent published three volumes of poetry, including the critically acclaimed collection \"HIV Mon Amour.\" Tory Dent passed away last Friday in New York. She was 47.", "Poet Adrienne Rich was a friend of Dent's. They met through phone calls and e-mails as writers who admired each other's work. Rich says Dent never held back in her poetry.", "Ms. ADRIENNE RICH (Poet): What's very remarkable about the language in these poems is that it can veer from great elegance to brutal realism. The revelations of the sense of betrayals of her body, disfigurements, infections and yet the language transcends morbidity as great poetic language can.", "NORRIS: Rich reads an excerpt from Tory Dent's poem \"What Calendars Have Become.\"", "Ms. RICH: (Reading) I refer to the world but I speak of the body. I want my body to reassure me, my castorized limbs to start signing madly in the air, swallows flapping to free themselves. Teach me, sensei, my body, teach me with sangfroid impartiality as you have all my life about the meaning of life. Teach me, as you did once, of athletic executions, the thrill of unskilled kicking on lake water. Teach me, as you did, of sexual collusion, the pure suspense of someone touching that way my skin, painful and exciting like running into a forest at midnight, my hair caught in branches, withered leaves abusing my face. I ran faster, willfully, into its dimensions, darkening as if blindfolded, of course.'", "NORRIS: That's Adrienne Rich reading the poem \"What Calendars Have Become.\" Rich says Tory Dent's poetry set a moral example.", "Ms. RICH: She teaches us that poetry not only is not equal to but must speak out of extremity and that in all extremity--AIDS, disaster, human disasters such as we're seeing around us constantly--that silence, if it's not death, it is defeat.", "NORRIS: Writing poetry made Tory Dent feel alive. Here she is in 2002, speaking on the radio program \"The Poet and the Poem\" from the Library of Congress.", "(Soundbite of 2002 radio broadcast)", "Ms. TORY DENT (Poet): Being sick is terribly redundant and I think why writing seems to cheer me up is that it always surprises me in terms of what I'm feeling, what I'm thinking, how I'm able to express the emotions and the physical discomfort I'm going through. And that makes life still within the elements of surprise that normal, healthy people seem to experience all the time.", "NORRIS: Tory Dent. She passed away on Friday due to an infection associated with AIDS. She was 47 years old. Dent's latest collection, \"Black Milk,\" was published just last month. You can read a poem from that collection at npr.org.", "ROBERT SIEGEL (Host): You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR."]

    paragraphs: ["DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:", "Governments around the world are building massive stockpiles of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. In the US, many consumers have purchased their own stocks of the drug. It's all a response to the possibility of a severe flu pandemic. What's unclear, though, is how effective Tamiflu would be if a pandemic actually strikes. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports.", "JON HAMILTON reporting:", "Let's say a pandemic does arrive. The US plan calls for handing out millions of doses of Tamiflu to reduce the death toll. Scientists say that's a reasonable approach since there's no vaccine for bird flu and Tamiflu appears to do some good. But the drug is no panacea. Here's Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He is testifying before the House Committee on International Relations.", "Dr. ANTHONY FAUCI (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): I want to caution the committee that we cannot equate stockpiling and availability of Tamiflu with preparedness. We have no hard scientific data of how well this antiviral will perform under the conditions of a pandemic.", "HAMILTON: Fauci says Tamiflu doesn't cure even regular flu.", "Dr. FAUCI: In seasonal flu, what this antiviral does is diminish the duration of symptoms by approximately a day and a half.", "HAMILTON: That's because Tamiflu doesn't kill the virus; it just slows it down so the body's immune system can catch up. Other scientists are more positive about Tamiflu and other existing antiviral drugs. Dr. Frederick Hayden is with the University of Virginia School of Medicine.", "Dr. FREDERICK HAYDEN (University of Virginia School of Medicine): The public needs to recognize that there are limitations with our current agents, that these are not magic bullets, but at the same time that these drugs can provide a great deal of benefit.", "HAMILTON: Which could mean the difference between life and death for some people infected with bird flu. Hayden says one of the limitations of Tamiflu is that it needs to be taken within a day or two after a person gets sick.", "Dr. HAYDEN: Once someone is in a desperate situation with advanced pneumonia, there's no evidence that antiviral treatment really does any good at that stage.", "HAMILTON: That's a problem with bird flu because patients often don't get diagnosed immediately. Hayden says another limitation is that ordinary flu viruses have shown they can develop resistance to Tamiflu.", "Dr. HAYDEN: We've known for some years that Tamiflu-treated patients can shed resistant virus. It's been seen in about one in five children, for example, treated for conventional human influenza.", "HAMILTON: More recently, scientists have found signs that bird flu virus also can develop resistance to Tamiflu. A recent study said two patients in Vietnam died after the virus became resistant.", "Hayden says that in spite of Tamiflu's limitations, it makes sense for governments to purchase large quantities. One reason is that even a small decrease in the severity of a flu pandemic would be worth the billions of dollars countries are spending on Tamiflu.", "Dr. HAYDEN: Drug stockpiling will likely be cost saving in the long run 'cause you need to balance that with respect to the enormous economic impact that a major influenza event could have.", "HAMILTON: Fauci, the government scientist, agrees Tamiflu could make a difference if a pandemic struck soon. But in his testimony before Congress, he pointed out that it will be years before the US stockpile is complete.", "Dr. FAUCI: The strategy is ultimately to have 75 million treatment courses to cover 25 percent of the population. We have assurances from the company that we will get to 20 million treatment courses by December of '06 and be 75 million by the summer or spring of '07.", "HAMILTON: That may be optimistic. Roche, the company that makes Tamiflu, is scrambling to fill orders, and other countries placed their orders for the drug well before the US did. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

    paragraphs: ["TERRY GROSS, HOST:", "Hugh Nissenson's novels have been nominated for the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award but critic Maureen Corrigan has a review of his latest timely novel, a work of historical fiction called \"The Pilgrim.\"", "MAUREEN CORRIGAN: I'll admit, it's kind of hokey to be talking about a novel called \"The Pilgrim\" right before Thanksgiving. What's even more quaint is the fact that \"The Pilgrim\" is one of those straightforward works of historical fiction, the likes of which we don't see so much anymore.", "In early- to mid-20th century America, publishers used to print lots of terrific popular historical fiction by the likes of Kenneth Roberts, F. Van Wyck Mason and C.S. Forester; then, the 1960s shook things up. We readers began to question these master narratives about the past all written by white guys. We began to wonder if Squanto and Sacagawea didn't have their own legitimate stories to tell.", "All this crucial cultural self-scrutiny tended to elbow traditional historical fiction - the kind of novel that primarily aims to tell an engrossing yarn - into a musty corner of the novel warehouse. That's why \"The Pilgrim\" is such a delightful find. Hugh Nissenson's moody, intelligent novel is about a tormented English Puritan who strikes out for the Plymouth Plantation in 1622.", "\"The Pilgrim\" isn't ignorant of our contemporary awareness that the truth about the past is complicated. For instance, it nods to the probability that Miles Standish and his militiamen might well have their own horrors to answer for when it came to relations with the Native Americans. But clearly, Nissenson isn't the kind of author who wants to self-consciously spin his mental wheels in the dust tracks of the past at the expense of telling a good story.", "\"The Pilgrim\" briskly moves along in its compelling tale of the perils of life in 17th century London and in the forest primeval of the New World. In doing so, it conjures up that dangerous black magic spell that the most powerful historical novels cast. \"The Pilgrim\" makes us feel that, even if this version of the past isn't quite accurate, this is the version we wholeheartedly believe, at least for the space of reading.", "In some of his other novels set in contemporary times, Nissenson's characters have been haunted by a desire for a religious faith that they can't rationally accept. The main character in \"The Pilgrim\", Charles Wentworth, gives us the Puritan spin on that existential dilemma. Charles hungers for salvation - in Puritan lingo, he yearns for a sign that he's one of the elect - while at the same time he suspects that he must be one of the damned.", "As he despairingly says at one point in the novel, my soul is a dry land, wherein no prayer can take root. Charles' father is a minister, and Charles himself is sent to Cambridge to prepare for the ministry. There he meets a fellow student, a secular soul mate whose predilection for making merry with barmaids results in his contracting smallpox, which he, in turn, he gives to Charles.", "Disfigured by the disease, Charles eventually is betrothed to a wealthy young woman named Sarah, whose face has also been ravaged by smallpox. But shortly before they're to be wed, Sarah accidentally snips the flesh of her forefinger as she's trimming her nails. Charles tells us he prayed for Sarah constantly. Once, he says to my shame, I prayed in the midst of making water. My prayer and my piss streamed together from my vile body, one heavenward and one in the chamber pot.", "To no avail. Sarah's finger turns black and she dies at age 19. Part of the guilty pleasure of reading a story like this is the grateful knowledge that we live in a time and a place where Band-Aids and antibiotics are at least theoretically available to all. Nissenson's vision of life in the 17th century teems with visions of public hangings and oozing sores, and the sense that any stray cough could signal the end.", "The ordeal of everyday life only grows more fraught for Charles when he emigrates to the New World. The good ship Swan stinks of the damp, spoiled victuals, rotting straw, spew, piss, and excrement. During the first winter Charles spends in Plymouth, he and other male colonists sell themselves as slave laborers to the Native Americans in exchange for some life-sustaining kernels of corn.", "But beyond its lushly grotesque detail, the great achievement of The Pilgrim is the way it fully transports us readers into a Puritan universe informed by the idea of predestination: a world where a decent guy like Charles is anguished every day by the mystery of whether he is saved or damned; a world I'm thankful to read about and thankful not to live in.", "GROSS: Maureen Corrigan teachers literature at Georgetown University. She reviewed \"The Pilgrim\" by Hugh Nissenson. You can download podcasts of our show on our website freshair.npr.org and you can follow us on Twitter at nprfreshair and join us on Facebook.
