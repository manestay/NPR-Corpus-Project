Mr. CARLIN: I like to stick to - right now, I like to stick to what they told us, which is that they had announced this a year ago, that nobody believed them, and now they wanted to show us that they do what they say they're going to do. "," 
This is very consistent with North Korean practice. From 2003 until the present, they have announced almost every step they're about to take along the way: start up the reactor, withdrawal of fuel rods, reprocess, even test. I don't know why they do that, I'll tell you the truth. "," 
And I think at this point, it is wise for people not to go too far in their speculation and not to exaggerate North Korean capabilities. That happens all too often, much of that in the media. And it's titillating to have this speculation, but it really isn't a basis for good policy going forward. "," 
KELLY: Well, Robert Carlin, thanks very much. ","I don't know why they do that, I'll tell you the truth. "

SMITH: Would you want one?"," 
GROSS: I don't know why you would. Most people who have any kind of wealth are interested in how it's managed. And blind trusts, because they're blind, you don't know what's going on with your money."," 
SMITH: Ken Gross has helped presidential candidates set up blind trusts. He says its complicated, expensive and generally a pain in the butt. But blind trusts do have one crucial advantage for a politician. It makes for an easy answer to a conflict of interest question. Mitt Romney used it in the Republican debates earlier this year."," 
MITT ROMNEY: My investments are not made by me. My investments for the last ten years have been in a blind trust managed by a trustee.", GROSS: I don't know why you would.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""TUNNEL VISION"")"," 
TIMBERLAKE: (Singing) I don't know why, but girl I'm feeling close to you. Maybe it's this ocean view. I'm so emotional and all these stars been dancing on my head. My head, my head. Too long, too long, too long. I wrote a song for you. I want to sing to you and every time I'm close to you the words want to come out but I forget. You're so strong. You're so strong. You're so strong."," 
(Singing) Didn't I seem like I would get you something? Just because it's true. Mm-hmm. I can't deny it. Mm-hmm. And I won't try it. Mm-hmm. But I think that you know. I look around and everything I see is beautiful because all I see is you. Mm-hmm. And I can't deny it. Mm-hmm. And I stand by it. Mm-hmm. And I won't hide it anymore."," 
TUCKER: I say this album may be a tough sell because the song lengths - most clock in at seven minutes-plus - don't initially come across as ready pop radio or download hits. Then, too, he's put out a neo-soul album inspired in part, he's said in interviews, by the expansiveness of '60s and '70s rock song formats. This is at a time when the musical landscape is dominated by the rough folk of acts like Mumford and Sons as well as glossier pop and country sounds."," TIMBERLAKE: (Singing) I don't know why, but girl I'm feeling close to you."

CORNISH: Every actor gets pigeonholed, and what are the ways casting directors tend to look at you?"," 
OSWALT: Oh, definitely the kind of geeky - I'm amazed I haven't done more like, you know, nerdy tech guys to the hot leading man in all these action movies. I don't know why I haven't been sitting in a van with headphones on, going ""We've lost the signal. Hey, guys, hello?"" You know, so, maybe that's in my future, I don't know. But, you know, I think that's, luckily, you know, with ""Big Fan"" and with ""Young Adult,"" I've been allowed to do roles that are more nuanced."," 
CORNISH: What do movies do for your stand-up?"," 
OSWALT: Oh, I mean, doing films and TV is great because, A, it's fun for me to do them and, B, it does bring out more people to see me do stand-up, which is ultimately what I want to do.","I don't know why I haven't been sitting in a van with headphones on, going ""We've lost the signal."
